    /// <para>A process can be attached to at most one console. If the calling process is already attached to a console, the error code returned is **ERROR\_ACCESS\_DENIED**. If the specified process does not have a console, the error code returned is **ERROR\_INVALID\_HANDLE**. If the specified process does not exist, the error code returned is **ERROR\_INVALID\_PARAMETER**. A process can use the [**FreeConsole**](freeconsole.md) function to detach itself from its console. If other processes share the console, the console is not destroyed, but the process that called **FreeConsole** cannot refer to it. A console is closed when the last process attached to it terminates or calls **FreeConsole**. After a process calls **FreeConsole**, it can call the [<see cref="AllocConsole"/>](allocconsole.md) function to create a new console or **AttachConsole** to attach to another console. This function is primarily useful to applications that were linked with [**/SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS**](/cpp/build/reference/subsystem-specify-subsystem), which implies to the operating system that a console is not needed before entering the program's main method. In that instance, the standard handles retrieved with [**GetStdHandle**](getstdhandle.md) will likely be invalid on startup until **AttachConsole** is called. The exception to this is if the application is launched with handle inheritance by its parent process. To compile an application that uses this function, define **\_WIN32\_WINNT** as `0x0501` or later.
