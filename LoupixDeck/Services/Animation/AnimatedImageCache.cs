/// Lifetime ownership is deliberate. A decoded animation's frames are handed out as shared
/// <c>SKBitmap</c> references: <see cref="ButtonAnimationSource"/> swaps them into
/// <see cref="Models.Layers.ImageLayer.CachedImage"/> on every device, the controller composites them
/// on a redraw, and the editor binds them for its preview. Those references outlive any single render
/// and live on threads this cache can't see, so disposing a frame while it is still referenced is a
/// use-after-free (an access violation in <c>SKBitmap</c>). Proving "no live reference" across the
/// editor + every page + the render thread is fragile, so the cache instead keeps each decoded
/// animation alive for its whole lifetime (it is a root singleton ≈ app lifetime) and frees the
/// native pixels only in <see cref="Clear"/>/<see cref="Dispose"/> at shutdown, when nothing renders.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Memory is bounded by the number of DISTINCT animations referenced during the session (each a
/// handful of 90×90 BGRA frames ≈ tens to low-hundreds of KB), which is modest for a deck config and
/// is reclaimed on restart. Re-importing a clip yields a new content-addressed key, so a replaced
/// animation lingers until restart — an acceptable trade for eliminating the crash.
